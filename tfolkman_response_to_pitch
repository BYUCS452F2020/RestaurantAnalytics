Hey Landen!

I think this is a great idea, and would love to help you out.
Business
I have in the past tried to start small businesses, where I have found that analytics go a long way in helping shape the direction of the company. 
So, I know that this could be a valuable resource and feel like I am following your idea.

Legal
I think that setting up an LLC would be a great idea.

Technical
I have worked with AWS in the past, not to say that I am an expert in any way, so I think that I could be useful in designing/coding the backend.
I would be willing to help out in anyway that I can. Im sure we could find a good way to be effective together as a team.

Thanks - Tanner
