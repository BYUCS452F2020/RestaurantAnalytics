# RestaurantAnalytics

## Project Description
We are in the middle of a new revolution where businesses now make decisions based off of numbers, results, and data, rather than the pure gut feeling and preference that has managed businesses for the past eternity. Unfortunately, these data providing tools to help these businesses be more successful are very expensive, however. So small businesses doing their best to be there best fall short even quicker because they can't make data-based decisions, without data. The Idea of Restaurant analytics is to provide an integrated platform for small locally owned restaurants for them to manage their menus, inventory, orders, etc and to provide analytical results back to the owners for their own education and ability to improve.

## Team
Still looking for two new members. If you want to join, reach out on slack, or email: bailey.landeng@gmail.com

## SQL
It'll be almost all in AWS

## No-SQL
Also AWS: I am leaning toward some DynamoDB simplicity, which I'm pretty sure is considered a Key-Value Style NoSQL database.

## Business
Once a front end is developed, we can present it to restaurants for free testing, and implementation. The long-term goal would be to provide multiple tier support plans for the analytics, with the base plan simply being access to the usage of the software.

## Legal
It'll be an LLC. Based initially here in Utah.

## Technical
It will be managed through lambda microservices, which will manipulate AWS Data servers.
