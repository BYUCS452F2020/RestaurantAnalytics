# RestaurantAnalytics

## Project Description
We are in the middle of a new revolutinos where businesses now make decisions based off of numbers, results, and data, rather then the pure gut feeling and preference that has managed businesses for the past eternity. Unfortunately, these data providing tools to help these businesses be more succesful are very expensive however. So small businesses doing their best to be there best fall short even quicker because they can't make data based decisions, without data. The Idea of Restaurant analytics is to provide an integrated platform for small locally owned restaurants for them to manage their menus, inventory, orders, etc and to provide analytical results back to the owners for their own education and ability to improve.
